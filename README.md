Overview

Soniv is a tool that converts audio data (from .wav files) into bitmap images or raw bit data. This beta version is intended for testing purposes and feedback.

Why

Soniv is about unpacking the potential of the universe. Soniv is a company built upon unraveling technological information and unpacking it into its simplest form.


Requirements

- Operating System: Windows (tested on Windows 10)
- Dependencies: The .exe file is standalone and should work without additional installations.

Installation

1. Download Soniv.exe.
2. Extract the file (if provided in a .zip archive).
3. Doubleclick Soniv.exe to launch the program.

Usage Instructions

1. Open a WAV File: Click "Browse WAV File" and select the .wav file you want to convert. Wavs up to 4 minutes have been tested and worked. You must wait until buttons can be clicked in order to convert.
2. Convert to Bitmap: Click "Convert to Bitmap" to generate a visual representation of the audio data as a bitmap image.
3. Save the Bitmap: To save the generated bitmap, click the save icon in the display when the bitmap appears.
4. Export Raw Data: Click "Export Raw Data" to save the audio data as raw bits in a .txt file.

Troubleshooting

- Antivirus Warnings: Some antivirus programs may flag the .exe file. Adding an exception for Soniv should resolve this issue.
- Error Messages: If you encounter an error during conversion, ensure your .wav file is not corrupt and try again.
- Wav Files: Wav files have been tested by converting .mp3 downloaded files from Youtube videos. Freesound.org provides Wav files that work with this program. 

Further Development/Next Steps
- Include customizable import settings for .wav files. Be able to manually select bitrate, mono v. stereo etc. This will enhance the quality of output.
- Fourier - Fourier is another Soniv Software Suite tool that allows you to convert raw .txt or bitmap files to .wav files. Stay tuned!
